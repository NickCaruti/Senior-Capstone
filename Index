In conducting the interviews, I had the opportunity to engage with coaches from Berry, Oglethorpe, and Lagrange. While I spoke with the coaches from Oglethorpe and Lagrange over the phone, I visited my coach from Berry in his office, where we discussed the questions at hand. Through these conversations, I gained valuable insights into the racial diversity present within each team.</li>
