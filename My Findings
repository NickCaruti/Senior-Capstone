          <h1 class="display-3">My Findings</h1>
          <p>This project has the potential to raise awareness about diversity issues in lacrosse by uncovering disparities in recruitment strategies. The findings can serve as a compelling case for securing extra funding to address these issues, advocating for the expansion of lacrosse programs into diverse communities. This dual impact aims to not only refine recruitment strategies but also contribute to positive change by promoting inclusivity and increasing opportunities for underrepresented individuals in the sport.
          <br>
          <br>
          The findings below stem from conversations I had with coaches from various colleges. My aim was to shed light on an issue within the sport we love and to assist coaches, players, and board members in recognizing and addressing this problem. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Through these discussions, it became evident that there are systemic challenges within lacrosse, particularly concerning diversity and inclusion. Coaches expressed concerns about the lack of representation from certain demographics and regions, highlighting a need for greater awareness and action to address these disparities. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Moreover, it was clear that this issue extends beyond mere recruitment strategies; it permeates the culture and accessibility of lacrosse itself. By bringing attention to these challenges, we can work towards fostering a more inclusive environment within the sport. It's essential for coaches, players, and board members to understand the gravity of this issue and to collectively take steps towards positive change. By acknowledging and confronting these challenges head-on, we can pave the way for a more diverse, equitable, and vibrant lacrosse community.
